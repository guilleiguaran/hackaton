Knockback.js provides Knockout.js magic for Backbone.js Models and Collections.

Some great advantages to using Knockback.js:

* make amazingly dynamic applications by applying a small number of simple principles

* leverage the wonderful work from both the Backbone and Knockout communities

* easily view and edit relationships between Models using an ORM of your choice:
  * [BackboneORM](http://vidigami.github.io/backbone-orm/)
  * [Backbone-Relational.js](http://backbonerelational.org/)
  * [Backbone Associations](http://dhruvaray.github.io/backbone-associations/)
  * [Supermodel.js](http://pathable.github.io/supermodel/)

* simplify program control flow by configuring your application from your HTML Views: think of it like Angular.js without memorizing all of the special purpose ng-{something} attributes. See the [Inject Tutorial](http://kmalakoff.github.com/knockback/tutorial_inject.html) for live examples!

###Replaceable Dependencies

* [LoDash](http://lodash.com/) - it you prefer LoDash to Underscore.js, we've got support for it!
* [Parse](https://www.parse.com/) - instead of Backbone.js, you can use Parse. Please note: there is no support for module loading and if you include Parse, it overrides Backbone.js and Underscore.js

###Compatible Components

* [BackboneORM](http://vidigami.github.io/backbone-orm/) - A polystore ORM for Node.js and the browser
* [Backbone-Relational.js](http://backbonerelational.org/) - Get and set relations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one) for Backbone models
* [Backbone Associations](http://dhruvaray.github.io/backbone-associations/) - Create object hierarchies with Backbone models. Respond to hierarchy changes using regular Backbone events
* [Supermodel.js](http://pathable.github.io/supermodel/) - Minimal Model Tracking for Backbonejs
* [BackboneModelRef.js](https://github.com/kmalakoff/backbone-modelref/) - provides a reference to a Backbone.Model that can be bound to your view before the model is loaded from the server (along with relevant load state notifications).
* [KnockbackNavigators.js](https://github.com/kmalakoff/knockback-navigators/) - provides page and pane navigation including history and state (useful for single-page and mobile apps). Can be used independently from Knockback.js.
* [KnockbackInspector.js](https://github.com/kmalakoff/knockback-inspector/) - provides customizable tree view of models and collections for viewing and editing your data (useful for debugging and visualizaing JSON).

###Modules to Extend Core

* 'knockback-defaults' - lib/defaults.js module. Comes bundled with knockback.js and knockback-full-stack.js.
* 'knockback-formatting' - lib/formatting.js module. Comes bundled with knockback.js and knockback-full-stack.js.
* 'knockback-localization' - lib/localization.js module. Comes bundled with knockback.js and knockback-full-stack.js.

* 'knockback-validation' - lib/validation.js module. Comes bundled with knockback.js and knockback-full-stack.js.
* 'knockback-statistics' - lib/statistics.js module. Not bundled with any library nor component.


Why Write Knockback.js?
-----------------------

When I was evaluating client-side frameworks, I liked lots of the pieces, but wanted to "mix and match" the best features. I started with [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) and really loved the Models and Collections, and used [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) to get me up and running quickly.

After a while, I found the view coding too slow so I wrote [Mixin.js](https://github.com/kmalakoff/mixin) to extract out reusable aspects of my views. When I was looking for my next productivity increase, an ex-work colleague suggested [Sproutcore](http://www.sproutcore.com/), but at the time, it wasn't yet micro-frameworky enough meaning I would need to learn something big and "to throw the baby out with the bathwater" as they say (it is hard to give up Backbone models and collections!). Then, I discovered [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) and knew it was for me!

Knockout provided just the right building blocks for a layer between my templates and data. As I used it more, I built additional functionality like [Backbone.ModelRefs](https://github.com/kmalakoff/backbone-modelref) for lazy model loading, localization helpers for truly dynamic views, and most recently, an easier way to sync collections and their model's view models.

So here it is...the refactored and shareable version of my Backbone bindings for Knockout: Knockback.js

Enjoy!

An Example
----------

### The view model:

```coffeescript
ContactViewModel = (model) ->
  kb.viewModel(model, {
    name:     'name'
    email:    {key:'email', default: 'your.name@yourplace.com'}
    date:     {key:'date', localizer: LongDateLocalizer}
  }, this)
  @           # must return this or Coffeescript will return the last statement which is not what we want!
```

or (Coffeescript)

```coffeescript
class ContactViewModel extends kb.ViewModel
  constructor: (model) ->
    super(model, {internals: ['email', 'date']})  # call super constructor: @name, @_email, and @_date created in super from the model attributes
    @email = kb.defaultObservable(@_email, 'your.name@yourplace.com')
    @date = new LongDateLocalizer(@_date)
```

or (Javascript)

```javascript
var ContactViewModel = kb.ViewModel.extend({
  constructor: function(model) {
    kb.ViewModel.prototype.constructor.call(this, model, {internals: ['email', 'date']});   // call super constructor: @name, @_email, and @_date created in super from the model attributes
    this.email = kb.defaultObservable(this._email, 'your.name@yourplace.com');
    this.date = new LongDateLocalizer(this._date);
    return this;
  }
});
```

### The HTML:

```html
<label>Name: </label><input data-bind="value: name" />
<label>Email: </label><input data-bind="value: email" />
<label>Birthdate: </label><input data-bind="value: date" />
```

### And...engage:

```coffeescript
view_model = new ContactViewModel(new Backbone.Model({name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@bob.com', date: new Date()}))
ko.applyBindings(view_model)

# ...

# and cleanup after yourself when you are done.
kb.release(view_model)
```

And now when you type in the input boxes, the values are properly transferred to the model and the dates are even localized!

Of course, this is just a simple example, but hopefully you get the picture.
